# Museum Of Candy

Museum is a frontend application built with CSS3 and HTML5. This project was used as practice to enhance my CSS skills and knowledge. This project was inspired by the uprising of Museums featuring candy across the United States. This website is designed to showcase candies from different areas, giving users that immersive feel like they're at the real thing.
